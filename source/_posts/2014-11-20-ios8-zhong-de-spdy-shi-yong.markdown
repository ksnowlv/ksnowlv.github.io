###spdy需要客户端和服务端同时支持。

<!--more-->

####1.spdy available on both OS X Yosemite and iOS 8
 
SPDY/2, SPDY/3, and SPDY/3.1 are supported Supported transparently by NSURLSession No source changes needed—it just works

``` objective-c
 NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://www.example.com/"];
  NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [[NSURLSession sharedSession]
        dataTaskWithURL:url
      completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response,
                          NSError *error) {
                          
   }];
  [task resume];

```

直接复用session,启用spdy.

####2.SPDY does require server-side support* Client negotiates with server during TLS handshake* Uses https:// URLs* Existing web server software and many CDNs already support SPDY Will not interfere with your NSURLProtocol subclasses* Apps might have their own implementation of SPDY or other protocols
